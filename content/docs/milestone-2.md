Milestone 2 focused on transforming the project’s inception work into concrete design artefacts and validating the foundations of the platform.  
This phase refined our understanding of the system, detailed its behaviour, and produced the models we will rely on for development.

# What We Achieved

## **✔ Architecture with Technology Choices**
Building on the high-level architecture defined in M1, we selected the technologies for each subsystem and refined the interactions between Core, Phishing Engine, LMS and Analytics.

## **✔ Requirements Refinement**
Functional and non-functional requirements were clarified and reorganised, ensuring full alignment with the personas and the intended feature set.   
[See Requirements ↗](/journey/requirements)

## **✔ Domain Model**
A complete domain model describing tenants, users, content, campaigns, remediation and LMS entities.  
[See Domain Model ↗](/journey/domain-model)

## **✔ Use-Case Model**
A unified view of how each actor interacts with the system across Core, Phishing and LMS.  
[See Use Cases ↗](/journey/use-cases)

## **✔ Data Model (Relational + Non-Relational)**
Full definition of the database structure: relational schema for core entities and MongoDB paths for templates, content and compliance material.  
[See Data Model ↗](/journey/data-model)

## **✔ Deployment Flow**
A clearer picture of how the system will be packaged, deployed and operated across environments.  
[See Deployment Flow ↗](/journey/architecture)

## **✔ Figma Mockups**
Updated interface concepts for the main user flows, representing the first visual language exploration.

# What This Milestone Represents

Milestone 2 closes the **Elaboration Phase** of the project.  
We now have:

- A stable architectural baseline  
- A complete functional view of the system  
- A structured domain and data model  
- Early UI validation  
- A clear path forward for development  

This prepares the team for **Milestone 3: MVP Development**, where we begin implementing the Core API, IAM, DB models, Admin & Org Manager dashboards, and first phishing/LMS features.
